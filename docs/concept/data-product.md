# Data Product

In later stages of the use case life-cycle, we can attach the use case to those
semantic data products that already exist and can provide the required information 
for the use case. 
However, it's important to note that the choice of semantic data products to 
be used for a given use case should be made based on their semantic relevance
and suitability to the use case's requirements.
