# Story

A Story --- in the context of a Use Case in the Use Case Tree --- defines a business requirement.

A business user could specify a requirement as follows:

- As the Chief Risk Officer, I need to know our current Risk Position against party B, so that I can Assess the Risk
- As an Auditor, I need to get a list of all current board members of legal entity X, so that I can Verify Stakeholders
- As an Employee, I need to get a list of all my colleagues in my unit, so that I Know my Colleagues
- As a customer, I need to get a list of all products, so that I can make a product selection

And so forth. That's all we ask.
