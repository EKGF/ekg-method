    ## What Is an Outcome?

    A **business outcome** is the specific result or benefit that an
    organization expects to achieve from a particular [Use
    Case](use-case.md).
    It is the reason why the use case exists and what it aims to
    accomplish.

    Outcomes answer the fundamental question: **"Why are we doing
    this?"**
    They provide the business justification for investing time,
    resources, and effort into a use case.

    ## Why Outcomes Matter

    Outcomes ensure that:

    - **Purpose is clear** — Everyone understands why the use case
      exists and what it's trying to achieve
    - **Alignment is maintained** — Use cases contribute to broader
      strategy and objectives
    - **Success can be measured** — Outcomes provide criteria for
      evaluating effectiveness
    - **Value is demonstrated** — Clear outcomes show how use cases
      contribute to organizational success

    !!! tip "Start with outcomes"

        Before defining what a use case does, understand why it
        exists.
        The outcome defines success and guides all decisions about
        implementation.

    ## Outcome Characteristics

    Business outcomes can vary depending on the use case and the
    organization's goals, but they should always:

    - **Align with strategy** — Support the broader strategy and
      objectives of the enterprise
    - **Be measurable** — Provide clear criteria for success
    - **Be achievable** — Realistic given available resources and
      constraints
    - **Be valuable** — Deliver meaningful benefit to the
      organization

    ## Examples

    Examples of business outcomes include:

    - **Risk Assessment** — "Assess the Risk" (from a risk
      management use case)
    - **Stakeholder Verification** — "Verify Stakeholders" (from an
      audit use case)
    - **Operational Efficiency** — "Reduce processing time by 50%"
    - **Compliance** — "Ensure regulatory compliance"
    - **Customer Satisfaction** — "Improve customer experience"

    Notice how outcomes appear in [Stories](story.md) as the "why"
    part: "...so that I can Assess the Risk" or "...so that I can
    Verify Stakeholders."

    ## Measuring Outcomes

    Measuring and tracking business outcomes is essential for:

    - **Evaluating effectiveness** — Understanding whether the use
      case is achieving its intended results
    - **Demonstrating value** — Showing how use cases contribute to
      organizational success
    - **Informing decisions** — Providing data for prioritization
      and resource allocation
    - **Continuous improvement** — Identifying opportunities to
      enhance outcomes

    Outcomes should be defined with measurable criteria from the
    start, enabling ongoing evaluation throughout the use case's
    lifecycle.

    ## What Is an Outcome in the EKG Method?

    An **Outcome** represents the business value or benefit that a
    [Use Case](use-case.md) is designed to deliver.
    It is the "why" part of the [Story](story.md) structure: "As a
    [Persona](persona.md), I need [capability], so that I can
    [Outcome]."

    Outcomes provide the business justification and success criteria
    for use cases, enabling alignment between business needs and
    technical implementation.

    ## Outcome Structure

    Outcomes are expressed in business language and typically follow
    patterns like:

    - **Action-oriented** — "Assess the Risk", "Verify Stakeholders"
    - **Benefit-focused** — "Reduce processing time", "Improve
      accuracy"
    - **Value-driven** — "Increase revenue", "Ensure compliance"

    The key is that outcomes are expressed in terms the business
    understands and values, not in technical terms.

    ## Outcome Stereotypes

    We can define **Outcome Stereotypes** to categorize outcomes
    based on their nature or purpose.
    If you want to call an outcome a "Goal", "Objective", or
    "Definition of Done", that's just a stereotype of Outcome.

    Common outcome stereotypes include:

    - **Goal** — A high-level, strategic outcome
    - **Objective** — A specific, measurable outcome
    - **Definition of Done** — A completion criterion for a use case
      or story
    - **Success Criteria** — Measurable conditions that indicate
      success
    - **Key Result** — A quantifiable outcome that supports a goal

    These stereotypes help organize and categorize outcomes while
    maintaining the fundamental concept that they all represent the
    "why" behind business requirements.
    The EKG Method uses "Outcome" as the base concept, with
    stereotypes providing additional semantic meaning as needed.

    ## Relationship to Stories

    Outcomes are the "why" component of Stories.
    Each Story specifies:

    - **Who** — The Persona who needs the capability
    - **What** — The capability or action needed
    - **Why** — The Outcome (the business benefit or purpose)

    This structure ensures that every requirement is tied to a clear
    business outcome, preventing the implementation of features that
    don't deliver value.

    ## Alignment with Strategy

    Outcomes should align with the broader strategy and objectives of
    the enterprise.
    This alignment ensures that:

    - **Use cases contribute to strategic goals** — Each use case
      delivers outcomes that support enterprise objectives
    - **Resources are prioritized** — Use cases with outcomes that
      align with strategy receive appropriate priority
    - **Value is maximized** — The EKG delivers capabilities that
      matter to the business

    ## Measuring and Tracking

    Outcomes should be defined with measurable criteria, enabling:

    - **Quantitative measurement** — Metrics that can be tracked
      and reported (e.g., "reduce processing time by 50%")
    - **Qualitative assessment** — Evaluation of quality or
      satisfaction (e.g., "improve customer experience")
    - **Continuous monitoring** — Ongoing evaluation throughout the
      use case lifecycle
    - **Value demonstration** — Clear evidence of contribution to
      organizational success

    The EKG can track outcomes by linking them to metrics, KPIs, and
    other measurement mechanisms, enabling automated reporting and
    analysis.

    ## Relationship to Other Concepts

    Outcomes relate to other core concepts:

    - **[Use Cases](use-case.md)** — Each use case has one or more
      outcomes that define its purpose
    - **[Stories](story.md)** — Stories specify outcomes as the
      "why" component
    - **[Personas](persona.md)** — Outcomes are achieved by
      Personas through Stories
    - **Strategy** — Outcomes align with enterprise strategy and
      objectives

    This integration ensures that outcomes are not abstract goals but
    concrete, measurable results that drive the EKG's value
    proposition.
