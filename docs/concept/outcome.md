# Outcome

A business outcome is the specific result or benefit that an organization expects
to achieve from a particular use case. 
It is the reason why the use case exists and what it aims to accomplish. 
Business outcomes can vary depending on the use case and the organization's goals, 
but they should always align with the broader strategy and objectives of the 
enterprise. 
Measuring and tracking business outcomes is essential for evaluating the effectiveness 
of a use case and its contribution to the overall success of the organization.
