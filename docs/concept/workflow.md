# Workflow

Every [Use Case](use-case.md) has one or more Workflows.

For every given use case, we also need to describe the logical order 
of things in terms of workflows or business processes. 
These workflows depend on the [concepts](./concept.md) captured during
the requirements gathering phase and are executed to achieve the desired 
business [outcome](./outcome.md). 
Each step in the workflow corresponds to executing a story in the use case,
and the concepts and terms used in the workflow are based on the
context-specific vocabulary identified during the requirements gathering phase.
