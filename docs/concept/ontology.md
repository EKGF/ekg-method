# Ontology

The ontologies act as a crucial intermediary between the demand and supply sides
of the information economy. 

On one hand, we have the use cases that represent the demands for information 
from various stakeholders, and on the other hand, we have the semantic data products
that represent the supply of information. 

The ontologies help bridge the gap between these two sides by providing a common
language that can be used to describe the concepts and relationships relevant to
both the demand and supply sides. 
This enables a more efficient and effective exchange of information, 
allowing organizations to better leverage their data assets and achieve 
their business objectives.
