# Use Case Tree Method

Your enterprise embarked upon a strategic innovative journey towards 
establishing a full scale Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG) in order 
to be able to:

1. implement use cases that enable more foundational data quality 
   for your enterpriseâ€™s business processes,
2. be more easily compliant with regulations and
3. enable strategic use cases that create a competitive advantage.

The key _artifact_ in the development of an EKG is "the Use Case Tree":

- The Use Case Tree is the EKG's equivalent of a long term
  data strategy and business capability plan.

- The Use Case Tree is the high-level requirements overview, 
  scoping and dependency model.
  It gives a _mile wide, inch deep_ view of business capabilities.

Traditionally, data strategy, architecture and models i.e.
_specifications of business requirements_ on one side and technology
and software, i.e. _functionality_ on the other side, are separate.
They are concerns of different departments; different groups of
specialists think about these concepts in their own way and have their
own practices and models for it. 
For any given development of a business capability that is supported 
by technology, different groups of people, often across many departments, will get involved and they all
have their own way of looking at it.
There is no shared language, not one single artifact that they can 
all talk to and reason about.
The Use Case Tree is that single artifact. 
It provides one single construct, owned by _the business_, and 
primarily driven by business strategy, that every group of people, 
every specialist, can relate their way of thinking to. 
This includes not only data and technology specialists but also project
managers, financial managers, security and compliance officers,
operations engineers and so forth. 
All their models and different ways of looking at a given capability 
can be plugged into the Use Case Tree as different views.

Everything we ever do in a business, especially in the data and
technology pillars of that enterprise, should be related to a use
case in the Use Case Tree.

The Use Case Tree is a breakdown of strategic planned-for 
capabilities into smaller building blocks, all called use cases.
Strategic long term use cases such as _Enterprise Risk Management_ 
or _Client 360_ are broken down into smaller use cases that 
can (and should) be done first.

Each use case is a module --- an EKG-component so you will --- 
a building block with which other use cases can be constructed.

The Use Case Tree Method is a practice that has been developed and
used for many EKG use cases that are running in production.
