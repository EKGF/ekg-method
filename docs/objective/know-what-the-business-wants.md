# Know what the business wants

Know exactly what the business --- i.e. the customer or product owner
--- really needs, short-, mid- and long-term.

1. <u>Plan phase: Discover the business opportunities & business needs</u><br/>
   One of the tasks during the planning phase of any new initiative
   --- or iteration --- is to "Discover" the business opportunities &
   needs:

    - In non-technical terms.

    - Without assuming anything about existing systems and "how
      things are done today".

    - Translate to "pure" functional requirements --- and "nice
      to haves".

    - Looking broad horizontally, thinking ahead. Mile wide, inch
      deep at this stage.

    - Let the business "dream a little" about "what could be"
      and "what should be", so that future needs can be
      identified and communicated --- without necessarily
      committing to them (yet).

    - Promote "thinking outside the box", encourage people to
      not make any assumptions about what is technically possible
      or not --- so often these assumptions unknowingly keep the
      bar lower than it could be.

2. <u>Build phase: Translate requirements into an easy to
   understand model i.e. the Use Case Tree</u><br/>
   "Contract with the business" i.e. the budget holder or
   product owner.
   Every major change to any given use case in the
   Use Case Tree will have to be signed off by the
   appropriate product owner.

    - Capture it as "meta-data" that will be part of the
      EKG --- all the way to production.

    - Capture it in such a way that "everything that we ever do"
      is always directly or indirectly relatable to a use case
      in the Use Case Tree.

    - The business never loses sight on what happens with their
      budget and agreed deliverables.
      All reporting to the business occurs in the context of
      the agreed , even after delivery.
