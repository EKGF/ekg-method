# I: Increase Quality

<!--summary-start-->
_Enforce 100% test coverage based on real business scenarios and requirements._
<!--summary-end-->

The [Use Case Tree](../concept/use-case-tree.md) is a foundational structure for quality 
--- any kind of quality --- 
since it enforces, requires and enables 100% test coverage 
based on real business scenarios and requirements.

- A use case has a life-cycle that starts with a name and a
  description and ends[^1] with a fully detailed model of all
  related concepts, personas, business outcomes, datasets,
  ontologies, user stories and dependencies.
  That model is all captured in the EKG itself which allows the
  EKG to not only fully and thoroughly test things during
  development time (build phase) but also in production
  (run phase).
  Which provides the level of quality that an EKG needs to
  have to become truly able to support enterprise level
  strategic use cases.

[^1]: Obviously, use cases can also be decommissioned after their life
in producton so in fact there are more stages in the life-cycle of a
use case
