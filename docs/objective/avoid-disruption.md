# Avoid Disruption

<!--summary-start-->
_TODO: Summary_
<!--summary-end-->

[Capturing all knowledge in the organization](capture-knowledge.md)
as much as technically possible is not only useful to enable a whole
new league of use cases but is also a necessity since all of these 
use cases are served by one platform --- albeit distributed and federated.
Which means that there will be many stakeholders with different agendas
that would not care --- nor should they have to care --- about the wishes 
of the stakeholders in other use cases.

However, updates to one use case could potentially also
affect other use cases.

That's why:

- <u>all changes & updates have to be done gradually,
  no ”big bang” releases</u> and
- <u>all interdependencies need to be really clear and
  tested, in-full, automatically and continuously.</u>

So, for instance, when some sub-use case of a high-level use case is
also used in another high-level use case then a change that serves
the needs of one could potentially also affect the other and its
users.
That's why we need the [Use Case Tree](/concept/use-case-tree), to allow us to avoid any disruption
across the board.
