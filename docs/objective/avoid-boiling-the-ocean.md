# Avoid "boiling the ocean"

Avoids "boiling the ocean" because the Use Case Tree and its individual use cases
define an agreed scope at the detail level (without becoming technical).

- Provides focus for the Center of Excellence (CoE), "cranking out" use cases one by one,
  according to the agreed roadmap.
- Ontology development will be focussed on delivering on the requirements (user stories and
  concepts) of the agreed use cases rather than ending up in philosophical exercise.
