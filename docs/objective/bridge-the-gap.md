# Bridge the traditional gap between Business & Technology

<!--summary-start-->
Align business expectations with technology delivery.
<!--summary-end-->

- Engage with the business, the product owner and get continuous
  buy-in from the product owner during the life-cycle of the
  agreed use cases.

- But not only with the product owner of the direct use case being
  developed but also show to the business what other future needs
  need to be considered.<br/>
  For instance, if one use case e.g. "Legal Entities" needs
  "workflows", would it make sense to invest a bit more effort
  to then create a reusable workflow component that can also 
  be used for many other use cases such as 
  "Shareholding disclosure"?

- Yes, the customer is always right but the [Use Case Tree](/concept/use-case-tree) 
  shows to the customer that there are many other customers
  (or future customers, in and outside the organization even)
  and why it makes sense to prioritize reuse and how that not 
  only could deliver more quality but also create more buy-in 
  from peer stakeholders across the firm or even across the 
  industry.

    * In other words, do not select one product owner to be the
      single stakeholder but also get other stakeholders of
      neighboring or higher level use cases in the room, their
      requirements may influence the reuse agenda and therefore
      the roadmap. It may sound paradoxal but investing in reuse
      will not slow things down but speed things up.
