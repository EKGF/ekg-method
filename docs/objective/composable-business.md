!!! info

    Work in progress. Points to make:

    - Explain that the [Use Case Tree (UCT)](/concept/use-case-tree) is the ultimate way to implement
      what Gartner now calls "Composable Business": 
        - https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable
    - Same for "Packaged Business Capabilities (PBCs)" (also called Packaged Business Components):
        - https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/what-are-packaged-business-capablities
        - https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/what-is-the-difference-between-PBCs-and-microservices
        - https://blog.dreamfactory.com/enterprise-it-building-blocks-the-packaged-business-capability/
    - Explain what's missing with the various proposed approaches in the articles above.
      Why Semantic Technology and in particular EKG & the UCT is key to _really_ make this fly.
