# Modularity

The standard approach for large projects, such as nuclear 
plants, ERP implementations, data-warehouses and subway systems, 
is to build monolithical bespoke systems. 
Subsequently, large investments need to be taken to even 
start the project and the project won’t deliver, in most cases, 
any value until completion. 
Even a project that is 95% complete, is often of no use to 
anyone until it is delivered, such as in the case of a 
nuclear plant. 
This problem also increases the risk that the project may get out 
of hand by requiring more time and budget while also failing 
on fulfilling the original project expectations.
Additionally, this approach offers little to no scalability
potential.

As a far more compelling approach, such large projects should,
according to
[Flyvbjerg](https://hbr.org/2021/11/make-megaprojects-more-modular),
be divided in smaller subprojects that can be tackled separately
and where each should deliver value independently of the rest.

    Professor Bent Flyvbjerg is the Executive Chairman of 
    Oxford Global Projects.
    He has 30+ years of experience as an advisor to government and business,
    including the US, UK, and Chinese governments, Fortune 500 companies, 
    and top consultancies.
    Flyvbjerg is the most cited scholar in the world on project management. 
    He is the first BT Professor and Inaugural Chair of 
    Major Programme Management at Oxford University and holds the 
    Villum Kann Rasmussen Professorship and Chair at the 
    IT University of Copenhagen. 
    He has received numerous honors and awards for his work on 
    better project management, including a knighthood and two 
    Fulbright Scholarships.

Flyvbjerg uses Madrid’s subway system as a mere example to illustrate 
the value of this approach. 
Manuel Melis Maynar was the person responsible for Madrid 
subway extension which added 131 km of rail, 79 new stations. 
This project started in 1995 and ended in 2003. 
Nonetheless, this project was and is still considered as a 
success story as it set records in terms of its speed and 
costs compared to other similar projects took up to 10 or 20 
years and cost much more that initially expected. 
This radical difference stems from a number of decisions 
that Melis’ took before starting this project:

- **No monuments**: Monuments and other forms of signature 
  architecture can be found in many subway stations but they are 
  also associated with cost overruns and delays. 
  Therefore, Manuel decided not to include any in its 79 
  stations and each station may follow a predefined replicable
  modular design based on well-proved construction methods.
- **No new technology**: Manuel avoided relying on new 
  construction techniques, tools or methods as they could add 
  risk to the project. 
  Instead, he relied on well-proved techniques, tools and 
  methods that had proved to deliver results fastly, cheaply, 
  safely, and at a high level of quality.
- **Speed**: Time is like a window as the bigger it is, 
  the more bad stuff can fly through it. 
  Manuel understood this as he determined that the project 
  needed to be delivered in incremental steps of 3-6 kilometers.
  This may enable workers and him to get feedback after each 
  step and to foster positive learning. 
  In other projects, this may also make possible to deliver 
  value to customers as soon as possible. 

Using this megaproject and other successful ones such 
Tesla’s Gigafactory, Flyvbjerg identified the principles 
behind scaling up in a smart way. 
By smart way, he means starting from small beginning to a 
large project through experimentation and relying on 
essentially identical modules. 
The opposite of this is to start on a massive scale with 
a project that mainly uses bespoke components. 
According to Flyvberg, the principles behind smart scale-ups 
are the following:

- **Speed**: As stated by former Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt;
  _“Create a product, ship it, see how it does, design and 
  implement improvements, and push it back out. 
  Ship and iterate.
  The companies that are the fastest at this process will win”_. 
  Speed is critical for companies not only to create momentum 
  but also to create a feedback loop between the company and 
  its environment to foster positive learning within companies. 
  Positive learning is defined by Flyvbjerg as; _“learning to 
  do things faster, better, and cheaper by doing the same 
  thing over and over, through replicated modules”_. 
  Additionally, tighter time frames result in more controllable
  chunks of work whose budget and other estimates are easier
  to calculate and are more reliable.
- **Replicable modularity**: By relying on rather high-quality
  identical modules that can be assembled into a larger project, 
  project managers can foster positive learning that will result
  in performance increases, lower project management risks and 
  in meeting the project expectations. 
  Additionally, working incremental steps also offers delivering
  customer value without having to complete the whole project
  first.
  For example, Tesla’s Gigafactory consists of different blocks
  that can be operated once completed and that can start
  producing batteries long before the whole Gigafactory has
  been finished.
  Lastly, relying on modules, whose value and workings have been
  tested before, significantly lowers the risks associated to
  bespoke solutions.

Although these concepts are not new to many engineering fields, 
they are rather new in the business world. 
However, they have been gaining attention recently by consulting 
companies such as Gartner with the so-called 
[Composable Business](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable)
which means; 
_“creating an organization made from interchangeable 
building blocks.”_ 
As stated by Gartner; 
_“A composable business is architected for real-time 
adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.”_ 
In turn, other companies such as 
[WalkMe](https://www.walkme.com/glossary/packaged-business-capabilities/), 
[Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/what-are-packaged-business-capablities)
and
[Venture Leap](https://venture-leap.com/en/the-leap/the-future-is-called-packaged-business-capabilities-2/)
consider packaged business capabilities as the 
building blocks of composable businesses.
