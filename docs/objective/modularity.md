# Modularity

<!--summary-start-->

_Build with modular, reusable components instead of monolithic
systems._

<!--summary-end-->

The standard approach for large projects, such as nuclear plants, ERP
implementations, data-warehouses and subway systems, is to build
monolithical bespoke systems. Subsequently, large investments need to
be taken to even start the project and the project won’t deliver, in
most cases, any value until completion. Even a project that is 95%
complete, is often of no use to anyone until it is delivered, such as
in the case of a nuclear plant. This problem also increases the risk
that the project may get out of hand by requiring more time and budget
while also failing on fulfilling the original project expectations.
Additionally, this approach offers little to no scalability potential.

As a far more compelling approach, such large projects should,
according to
[Flyvbjerg](https://hbr.org/2021/11/make-megaprojects-more-modular),
be divided in smaller subprojects that can be tackled separately and
where each should deliver value independently of the rest.

<div markdown> Professor Bent Flyvbjerg is the Executive Chairman of
Oxford Global Projects. He has 30+ years of experience as an advisor
to government and business, including the US, UK, and Chinese
governments, Fortune 500 companies, and top consultancies. Flyvbjerg
is the most cited scholar in the world on project management. He is
the first BT Professor and Inaugural Chair of Major Programme
Management at Oxford University and holds the Villum Kann Rasmussen
Professorship and Chair at the IT University of Copenhagen. He has
received numerous honors and awards for his work on better project
management, including a knighthood and two Fulbright Scholarships.

Flyvbjerg uses Madrid’s subway system as a mere example to illustrate
the value of this approach. Manuel Melis Maynar was the person
responsible for Madrid subway extension which added 131 km of rail, 79
new stations. This project started in 1995 and ended in 2003.
Nonetheless, this project was and is still considered as a success
story as it set records in terms of its speed and costs compared to
other similar projects took up to 10 or 20 years and cost much more
that initially expected. This radical difference stems from a number
of decisions that Melis took before starting this project:

- **No monuments**: Monuments and other forms of signature
  architecture can be found in many subway stations but they are also
  associated with cost overruns and delays. Therefore, Manuel decided
  not to include any in its 79 stations and each station may follow a
  predefined replicable modular design based on well-proved
  construction methods.
- **No new technology**: Manuel avoided relying on new construction
  techniques, tools or methods as they could add risk to the project.
  Instead, he relied on well-proved techniques, tools and methods that
  had proved to deliver results fastly, cheaply, safely, and at a high
  level of quality.
- **Speed**: Time is like a window as the bigger it is, the more bad
  stuff can fly through it. Manuel understood this as he determined
  that the project needed to be delivered in incremental steps of 3-6
  kilometers. This may enable workers and him to get feedback after
  each step and to foster
  [positive learning](../vocab/positive-learning.md). In other
  projects, this may also make possible to deliver value to customers
  as soon as possible.

Using this mega-project and other successful ones such Tesla’s
Gigafactory, Flyvbjerg identified the principles behind scaling up in
a smart way. By smart way, he means starting from small beginning to a
large project through experimentation and relying on essentially
identical modules. The opposite of this is to start on a massive scale
with a project that mainly uses bespoke components. According to
Flyvberg, the principles behind smart scale-ups are the following:

- **Speed**: As stated by former Google’s CEO, Eric Schmidt; _“Create
  a product, ship it, see how it does, design and implement
  improvements, and push it back out. Ship and iterate. The companies
  that are the fastest at this process will win”_. Speed is critical
  for companies not only to create momentum but also to create a
  feedback loop between the company and its environment to foster
  [positive learning](../vocab/positive-learning.md)positive learning
  within companies. Positive learning is defined by Flyvbjerg as;
  _“learning to do things faster, better, and cheaper by doing the
  same thing over and over, through replicated modules”_.
  Additionally, tighter time frames result in more controllable chunks
  of work whose budget and other estimates are easier to calculate and
  are more reliable.
- **Replicable modularity**: By relying on rather high-quality
  identical modules that can be assembled into a larger project,
  project managers can foster
  [positive learning](../vocab/positive-learning.md) that will result
  in performance increases, lower project management risks and in
  meeting the project expectations. Additionally, working incremental
  steps also offers delivering customer value without having to
  complete the whole project first. For example, Tesla’s Gigafactory
  consists of different blocks that can be operated once completed and
  that can start producing batteries long before the whole Gigafactory
  has been finished. Lastly, relying on modules, whose value and
  workings have been tested before, significantly lowers the risks
  associated to bespoke solutions.

Although these concepts are not new to many engineering fields, they
are rather new in the business world. However, they have been gaining
attention recently by consulting companies such as Gartner with the
so-called
[Composable Business](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable)
which means; _“creating an organization made from interchangeable
building blocks.”_ As stated by Gartner; _“A composable business is
architected for real-time adaptability and resilience in the face of
uncertainty.”_ In turn, other companies such as
[WalkMe](https://www.walkme.com/glossary/packaged-business-capabilities/),
[Elastic Path](https://www.elasticpath.com/blog/what-are-packaged-business-capablities)
and
[Venture Leap](https://venture-leap.com/en/the-leap/the-future-is-called-packaged-business-capabilities-2/)
consider packaged business capabilities as the building blocks of
composable businesses.
