# Align with Business Strategy

<!--summary-start-->

_Align strategy of business capability improvement and execution._

<!--summary-end-->

Creating an agreed and realistic strategic roadmap that is aligned to
_business strategy_ is hard. Most---if not all---large enterprises are
complex and consist of many _lines of business_ (LOBs) where each
business has its own "business identity" and therefore its own long
term strategy. Each of these organizational divisions has its own
agenda.

The [Use Case Tree](../concept/use-case-tree.md) is the single
artifact that all lines of business can talk to.

## Business Capability Map

At the highest levels, the
[Use Case Tree](../concept/use-case-tree.md) will end up being
identical---or almost identical---to a _business capability map_.

Here's an example of a simplified capability map of an insurance
company (taken from the article mentioned as source 1 below):

Most large organizations have an Enterprise Architecture or Business
Architecture department that works on these models but in many cases:

- these capability maps are just maintained as pictures or
  spreadsheets and therefore
  - often out of sync with reality
  - not really fully ingrained in the hearts and minds of the
    workforce
- they are usually:
  - not represented in production-level systems and if they are then
    they are:
  - not represented in user interfaces (text may look the same but
    doesn't dynamically change when the capability map changes)
  - not represented in APIs (parameters, returned data structures etc)
  - not represented in data models
- they have bad linkage with similar hierarchical structures such as:
  - the organizational unit structure and reporting lines
  - the product and services catalog
  - the actual business processes
  - the actual internal data, technology, products and services supply
    chains

## Next-level Capability Map

The [Use Case Tree](../concept/use-case-tree.md) serves as the next
level in Business Capability Mapping where each capability gets broken
down into smaller capabilities each of which ends up as an executable
model --- or component or model so you will --- in the EKG itself.
