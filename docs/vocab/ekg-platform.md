# EKG/Platform

_EKG/Platform_ is EKGF's brand name for the overall technical infrastructure
that runs the Enterprise's Knowledge Graph.

An EKG requires a "platform" to run it, where the term "platform" is used 
for the collection of software services that serve the content of the EKG 
to users and systems.

The EKG/Platform can be seen as a "layer" on top of all your other data sources,
providing a "holistic view"---from a user perspective---to all data and knowledge,
often down to its finest detail, that is captured from all your other data sources,
connecting all data.
