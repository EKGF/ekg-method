# Train

<!--summary-start-->
Get everyone involved up to speed with all the fundamentals around EKG, the various
new paradigms and especially how EKG requires a number of new ways of looking at various
topics.
<!--summary-end-->

Provide expert training classes covering the core concepts and technologies 
that underpin the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.
Demystify semantic technology for business stakeholders and provide guidance
to architects and engineers on the core concepts needed for model-driven architecture.
Programs can be customized to your specific EKG strategy and are designed 
to provide all stakeholders with knowledge about the fundamental EKG principles.

## Audience

- ...
- Any member of the EKG CoE
- EKG Champion(s)
