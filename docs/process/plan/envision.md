# Envision

<!--summary-start-->
_Create a vision for the EKG that is shared by all key-stakeholders._
_This is about “the why” long term._
<!--summary-end-->

Create a <ins>shared</ins> vision, where do we think that our organization should be,
three to ten years down the road and how do we leverage our unique data and knowledge to become,
or stay, a leader in our markets? Translate this to a (long term) integrated business, data
and technology strategy, identify primary stakeholders and initial scope.

Clarify the potential of knowledge graph for your enterprise and help position it 
as part of your overall data and technology strategy. 
Frame the value of knowledge graph and demonstrate how it can solve your most 
complex data problems.
Facilitate the understanding of core concepts, help your organization to 
leverage the full potential of precisely-defined and fully-connected data.

## Approach 

Conduct interactive workshops with senior stakeholders to explore the 
realities of becoming a ”data-centric” organization. 
Concentrate on the key [EKG principles](https://principles.ekgf.org/principle/#__tabbed_1_2) 
of [identity](https://principles.ekgf.org/principle/01-identity/), 
[precision of meaning](https://principles.ekgf.org/principle/02-meaning/), reuse and
scalability.
Apply state-of-the-art architectural thinking to craft a revised strategy, 
where knowledge graph takes its place as a key component in the data and technology
landscape.

## Audience

The envision-phase covers topics that are of interest to representatives 
of all four capability domains ([Business](https://maturity.ekgf.org/pillar/#__tabbed_1_1),
[Data](https://maturity.ekgf.org/pillar/#__tabbed_1_3), 
[Technology](https://maturity.ekgf.org/pillar/#__tabbed_1_4) and 
[Organization](https://maturity.ekgf.org/pillar/#__tabbed_1_2))
but focuses on the benefits for the business as a whole.

- Executive Management (Business-side and CDO, CIO, CTO, CRO, CFO or their directs)
- Business Representatives
- Key stakeholders in a given scope

## Outputs

1. Shared Strategy document.<br /> 
   A shared data and technology vision that bridges perspectives among 
   across business, technology and data executives.
2. Ability to demystify fundamental concepts associated with semantic 
   technology and Enterprise Knowledge Graphs.
3. Detailed understanding of the functions and capabilities of the EKG
   and how it can be leveraged within your business.
4. High-level view of architectural alternatives for knowledge graph
   deployment.

**The Shared Strategy document is the final tangible deliverable of 
the Envision phase that serves as input to all subsequent phases.**

## Topics

### Vision

* What is EKG and why is it the way forward?
* Discuss and capture your current long-term vision, how is your
  business creating a competitive advantage leveraging its data and 
  knowledge. Get key-stakeholders involved, capture their view on the
  business vision and how they think that data management, technology and
  organization will or should support that vision.
* Trends in information-intensive industries and their impact on 
  business data, technology, and organizational structure and culture.
* Explanation---in business terms---of what an EKG is and what 
  business benefits it could deliver.
* Assess the impact of EKG, i.e. capturing all knowledge that is 
  currently siloed and captured in all the various systems in a 
  given scope and ecosystem on business data, technology and organization.
* Do an initial discovery of the “strategic use cases”---that cannot be 
  realistically done today---and choose the initial focus area giving 
  scope for all subsequent phases.

### Paradigms 

Key Paradigm Changes (in non-technical business terms) such as:

* [_Open World_](https://principles.ekgf.org/principle/04-open-world/) vs _Closed World_
    - “_Multiple versions of the truth_” (MVOT) vs [“_Single version of the truth_” (SVOT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_version_of_the_truth)
* The key Semantic Technologies and their impact
* How to apply best practices from the software development world to
  the data world such as 
  [_TDD/BDD_](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/tdd-vs-bdd), 
  _DevOps_ / [_GitOps_](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/gitops) (becoming: _DataOps_ / _SemOps_ / _EKGOps_),
  [_Continuous Improvement_](https://www.planview.com/resources/guide/lean-principles-101/what-is-continuous-improvement/),
  [_Continuous Integration_](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration), 
  [_Continuous Delivery_](https://continuousdelivery.com/), 
  [_Continuous Deployment_](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/principles/continuous-integration-vs-delivery-vs-deployment),
  [_Infrastructure as Code (IaC)_](`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code`)
* Agile and how this applies to one single EKG serving many agendas and how company culture and current practices may prohibit innovation
* _Composability_, [_Composable Business_](https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable), _Packaged business capabilities (PBCs)_, 
  _Reusable Data Components_, _Reusable Business Components_ and how that relates to the _[Use Case Tree](/concept/use-case-tree)_
* Various “Delusions” in Data Management
* The economics of EKG
* Breaking the technical, legal, organizational and cultural silos

### Key Success Factors & Lessons Learned

* Learning from mistakes, what to do differently, how to set up for success
* Why a traditional _Proof-of-Concept (PoC)_ does not work with EKG

### Method Summary

* Explain (in business terms) what “the method” is, why it is essential 
  to have an agreed, standardized and measurable approach. 
  How can one EKG serve all agendas across the enterprise successfully?
* [Use Case Tree](/concept/use-case-tree)s (Summary)
* Maturity Model (Summary)
    * EKG Maturity Levels in the Business realm
    * EKG Maturity Levels in the Organization (in general) realm
    * EKG Maturity Levels in the Data realm
    * EKG Maturity Levels in the Tech realm
* EKGOps/DataOps (Summary)

### Shared Strategy 

Development of a “shared strategy” where all key stakeholders agree to 
align on a shared vision and how to get there. 
One could say---in the context of EKG---that [Business Strategy](../../objective/align-with-business-strategy.md)
should drive Data Strategy which in turn should drive Tech and Org Strategies[^see-bs].
The Shared Strategy document is the final tangible deliverable of 
the Envision phase that serves as input to all subsequent phases.
