# Assess

<!--summary-start-->

- current state
- required next state
- maturity (buss/org/data/tech)
- scalability assessment

<!--summary-end-->

Perform an assessment of the current and desired state of maturity of the organization
as it relates to the selected scope of the use case tree in terms of business, data, technology and
other organizational maturity topics, based on [EKG/Maturity](https://maturity.ekgf.org).
This is primarily about the ”non-functional requirements”, ensuring successful
implementations of enterprise wide use cases.

The Assess phase is a formal evaluation of the readiness of the organization
to leverage the potential of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.

The evaluation---based on [EKG/Maturity)](https://maturity.ekgf.org)---considers
four capability domains of your enterprise (business, data, technology and organizational capabilities) 
to provide you with an EKG that matches your business objectives.

Given the use cases that you described in your use case tree, in the previous step
of the method (see Discover), we now need to be able to assess whether your enterprise
has mature capabilities to deliver these use cases and deliver on the specified outcomes.
The characteristics of these outcomes are described in the "dimensions" of each of the
capabilities that are documented in the EKG/Maturity model.

At a very high level, we've defined "[Purposeful Business Themes](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/)"
where each theme is a collection of desired "outcomes".
Each of these outcomes can be mapped to the Dimensions that we defined per Capability
in the Maturity Model.

For instance, you have identified "KYC Use Case", a highly regulatory use case in the financial industry,
what's the coverage level of ontologies, so that we can deliver on the outcomes defined as part of the business purpose 
"[Manage Risk & Compliance](https://principles.ekgf.org/theme/manage-risk-and-compliance/)".

Concentrate on producing a gap analysis that addresses your requirements---i.e. 
when use of controls is a _non-functional requirement (NFR)_---in the context of
a sustainable and realistic EKG implementation.

## Approach

The key to the Assess phase is a detailed _readiness evaluation_ to understand 
limitations and interdependencies across the enterprise (by line of business and by key shared activities).

Use the [Maturity Model for the EKG (EKG/Maturity)](https://maturity.ekgf.org) as 
a framework for creating a baseline assessment and as a basis for 
_continuous evaluation_ and _continuous improvement_.

Conduct interviews with your key personnel and review key documents for
both completeness and repeatability. 
The EKG/Maturity approach results in a scorecard of capabilities across linked processes.

## Outputs

- Assessment of business enablers as input to a business case.
    - The business case will be worked on in the next step "Chart".
    - 
- into building a business case and for 
  obtaining commitment from key stakeholders.
- Explicit gap analysis to clarify deficiencies and define the scope of work
  required to deliver against EKG requirements.
- Evaluation of team capabilities, data management maturity, 
  control mechanisms, standards, models and technical architectures.
- Expectation management and considerations for business case development.
