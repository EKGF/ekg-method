# Assess

<!--summary-start-->
_Assess where your current organization stands in terms of the non-functional requirements and
where it should be to be able to support the use cases as they come out of the [Discover phase](discover).
These assessments are based on the [EKG/MM](../../vocab/maturity-model).
This is partly about "the how" and "can we?"._
<!--summary-end-->

Perform an assessment of the current and desired state of maturity of the organization
as it relates to the selected scope of use cases in terms of business, data, technology and
other organizational maturity topics, based on the Maturity Model for the Enterprise
Knowledge Graph (EKG/MM).
This is primarily about the ”non-functional requirements”, ensuring successful
implementations of enterprise wide use cases.

The Assess phase is a formal evaluation of the readiness of the organization
to leverage the potential of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph.

The evaluation--–based on the 
[Maturity Model for the Enterprise Knowledge Graph (EKG/MM)](../../vocab/maturity-model)---considers
four core dimensions---or capability domains so you will---of your environment
(business, data, technology and organizational capabilities) 
to provide you with an EKG that matches your business objectives.
Concentrate on producing a gap analysis that addresses your 
requirements---i.e. the _non-functional requirements (NFRs)_---in the context of
a sustainable and realistic EKG implementation.

## Approach

The key to the Assess phase is a detailed readiness evaluation to understand 
interdependencies and limitations.

Use the EKG/MM as a framework for creating a baseline assessment and as a 
basis for continuous evaluation and continuous improvement.

Conduct interviews with your key personnel and review key documents for
both completeness and repeatability. 
The EKG/MM approach results in a scorecard of capabilities across linked processes.

## Outputs

- EKG maturity assessment as input into building business cases and for 
  obtaining commitment from key stakeholders.
- Explicit gap analysis to clarify deficiencies and define the scope of work
  required to deliver against EKG requirements.
- Evaluation of team capabilities, data management maturity, 
  control mechanisms, standards, models and technical architectures.
- Expectation management and considerations for business case development.
