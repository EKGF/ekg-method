<!--summary-end-->

Build a business case that charts out a solid plan, well-supported by all 
key-stakeholders and “champions”, setting up for successful delivery of the 
first use cases in production and establishing the foundation for a “CoE” 
for the EKG.

Use the outcomes of "[Envision](envision.md), [Discover](discover.md),
[Assess](assess.md) & [Train](train.md)" to develop a well-justified 
thorough ”business case”.

Think big, start small, but have a solid and well-supported plan to be used
for strategy prioritization, internal budget approvals, 
compliance/security approvals, technical approvals, 
creating proper air-cover and mandate, setting up for success.
