<!--summary-start-->
_Craft a proper "business case", manage expectations, define crystal clear what success
means and what is needed to get there.
This is about "when are we done?"._
<!--summary-end-->

Build a business case that charts out a solid plan, well-supported by all 
key-stakeholders and “champions”, setting up for successful delivery of the

[Assess](assess) & [Train](train)" to develop a well-justified 
thorough ”business case”.
