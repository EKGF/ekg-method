# Plan

=== "Intro"

    **<!--summary-plan-start-->
    _Think big, start small, rinse, repeat, accelerate._
    <!--summary-plan-end-->**
    
    [//]: # (??? note "Rationale")
    
    In most large organizations, there are many ways to justify a migration to a more data-centric and less
    siloed operation. There are countless use cases where a more data-centric and “holistic” approach could
    be extremely beneficial. Starting with EKG requires planning and preparation. Think big, start small. 
    Start with the right use case, the right business case, the right team, prepare for success.
    Establishing an EKG can be seen as a journey, it’s generally not something that can be done in “three
    months”, even though---with the right amount of planning and preparation---the first use case that can
    be delivered can be done in such a short time-frame, it should fit in a larger vision and strategy. Proper
    expectation management is key.
    
    Since EKG brings in many new “paradigms”, it is crucial to have proper expectation management in place,
    all relevant stakeholders in the given scope need to understand what it is that you’re trying to achieve,
    what the longer-term vision behind it is, agree on that vision, whereby the first use cases need to be
    very convincing and need to be delivered successfully.
    
    That's what this method is for. See also all other [objectives](../../objective/index.md).
