# Plan

[//]: # (??? note "Rationale")

In most large organizations, there are many ways to justify a migration to a more data-centric and less
siloed operation. There are countless use cases where a more data-centric and "holistic" approach could
be extremely beneficial. Starting with EKG requires planning and preparation. Think big, start small. 
Start with the right use case, the right business case, the right team, prepare for success.
Establishing an EKG can be seen as a journey, it's generally not something that can be done in "three
months", even though---with the right amount of planning and preparation---the first use case that can
be delivered can be done in such a short time-frame, it should fit in a larger vision and strategy. Proper
expectation management is key.

Since EKG brings in many new "paradigms", it is crucial to have proper expectation management in place,
all relevant stakeholders in the given scope need to understand what it is that you're trying to achieve,
what the longer-term vision behind it is, agree on that vision, whereby the first use cases need to be
very convincing and need to be delivered successfully.

That's what this method is for. See also all other [objectives](../../objective/index.md).
