# Run

=== "Intro"

    ***<!--summary-run-start-->
    Running one EKG platform with use cases that have to serve many completely different
    type of stakeholders across the firm, all using reusable data from many sources, 
    is no small feat and for many organizations the first time that such a platform 
    enters the organization the bar is likely to be raised in many ways for all people 
    that are involved in delivering, operating and optimizing that platform with all its 
    use cases (even though many organizations obviously already run systems that are 
    used enterprise wide, in most cases those systems only serve ^^one^^ particular slice 
    of functionality, not many).
    <!--summary-run-end-->***
    
    Once the [EKG/Platform](/vocab/ekg-platform/) has been [deployed](deploy) in 
    production, it needs to be supported and maintained. 
    Or [Operated](operate), [Measured](measure) and [Optimized](optimize) so you will.
    
    We recommend to allocate funding for these services, whether they are performed 
    by your CoE or by an external consultancy firm, from _Business-as-Usual (BAU)_
    (or _Run-the-Bank (RTB)_) budgets because these services are not directly related 
    to particular projects or use cases.
