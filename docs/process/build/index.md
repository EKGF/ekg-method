# Build

=== "Intro"
 
    **<!--summary-build-start-->
    _"Building" an EKG-based use case involves 
    everything from detailed requirements gathering---structured 
    around the Use Case Tree---all the way up to delivery of
    components for your production EKG-platform._
    <!--summary-build-end-->**
 
    !!! info "no-code"
    
        In general, for most use cases, there is very little actual
        coding (or "building") involved since the majority of use cases
        can be done in a ”low-code” or even ”no-code” manner by specifying all
        details of all functional requirements in the context of the
        UCT which then all ends up as ”executable models” in the 
        EKG itself.
        Most of the actual "building" of the use case consists of
        adding more detail to the use case at hand. Capturing more knowledge
        about it. Once enough detail has been specified, it runs, job done.
   
=== "Steps"

    <div class="grid cards" markdown>
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Allocate__
    
         {% include-markdown "allocate.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](allocate.md)
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Design__
    
         {% include-markdown "design.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](design.md)
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Implement__
    
         {% include-markdown "implement.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](implement.md)
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Test__
    
         {% include-markdown "test.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](test.md)
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Verify__
    
         {% include-markdown "verify.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](verify.md)
    
    - :material-cached:{ .lg } __Deliver__
    
         {% include-markdown "deliver.md"
         start="<!--summary-start-->" end="<!--summary-end-->" %}
         [:octicons-arrow-right-24: Learn more](deliver.md)
    
    </div>

=== "Inputs"

    To set up for success, it is essential that the build phase starts with 
    the following artifacts and results that are created during the [plan phase](../plan)
    are input for the build phase:

    - **From [Envision](../plan/envision):** A shared vision and strategy, 
      an agreed overall scope and direction, all stakeholders are identified 
      and are supporting the strategy.
    - **From [Discover](../plan/discover):** The UCT, a broad-stroke overview
      of all use cases in the agreed scope with agreed names and
      "Business Outcomes" plus abstract business descriptions of functional
      requirements. (Details of the UCT to be determined during the build phase).
    - **From [Assess](../plan/assess):** A light assessment of the various 
      non-functional requirements and levels of maturity in the areas of 
      the organization that the EKG and the EKG team would depend on plus 
      a plan as to how to bridge gaps.
    - **From [Train](../plan/train):** Depending on the size of the 
      selected use cases and their scope, everyone involved should have
      gone through some light basic training where the various new concepts 
      around EKG have been explained, especially the members of the initial team.
    - **From [Chart](../plan/chart):** An agreed, supported and funded project 
      plan. With a well-defined _definition of done (DoD)_ or a definition 
      of what a successful delivery of the selected use cases means,
      ideally around agreed business outcomes.

=== "Critical success factors"
    
    1. Creating an EKG can only be successful if it is done as part of the
       company’s strategy with solid top-down support and leadership.
       - Bottom-up development of just one Knowledge Graph Use Case will only 
         lead to "yet another silo (YAS)" and cannot realistically compete
         with existing technology stacks, missing out on the actual benefits
         that EKG can provide.
    3. An EKG requires internal ownership and a team that understands
       the many new paradigms that are involved.
        - Creating a solid team---let's call it the [Center of Excellence (CoE)
          for the EKG](../../vocab/coe)---is essential.
        - It is not the technology that holds us back---the technology works---it
          is the internal organization’s readiness and level of maturity in a
          number of areas that require focus.
          Perform a solid [maturity assessment](../plan/assess.md).
    5. A [structured method](https://method.ekgf.org) is required that covers
       all areas, from strategy and idea inception to capturing the right 
       business outcomes and requirements all the way to delivering a 
       use case in production and supporting it during its life cycle.
    6. Any investment in a properly executed [plan phase](../plan) will 
       drastically increase the likelihood of successful delivery.
