Use cases can be modelled and be made part of the Enterprise Knowledge Graph
by loading these models in one of the backend semantic graph databases.

For any given use case, there are one or more stories where each story
can be executed via some protocol, for instance via HTTP as a REST-API
or a WebSocket message.
This is what the [Story Service](https://story-service.agnos.ai) does: 
it serves the stories of your use case.

Before you deploy your use case to a production environment you want
to know whether your use case and all its stories have the right
expected quality. In other words, your stories need to be tested.
This is where [RDChoke](https://rdchoke.agnos.ai) comes in, it tests
all your stories for a given set of use cases against any of the
supported backend data stores.
