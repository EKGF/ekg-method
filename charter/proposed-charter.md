## Mission

Develop and standardize the Use Case Tree (UCT) framework to facilitate the structured definition, organization, and evolution of enterprise knowledge graph (EKG) use cases across industries. The ultimate goal is to create a central EKGF-hosted repository where enterprises can publish and access fully reusable, production-ready use cases, paving the way for OMG standardization.

## Scope

The Use Case Tree Workgroup builds upon the methodologies established by the former Method Workgroup (active between 2019 and 2022). This initiative seeks to advance the use case tree model, emphasizing modularity, reusability, and interoperability. A key objective is to establish a central registry on [https://method.ekgf.org](https://method.ekgf.org) where reusable, production-ready use cases—akin to packages on pypi.org or npmjs.org—can be shared and adopted across enterprises. 

Each use case represents a scoped, agreed-upon set of business requirements, effectively serving as a "contract with the business" that specifies information demands. This aligns with a data economy or data marketplace paradigm, where the use cases reflect the demand side of the business’s information needs, while the supply side is represented by data products, enabling a balanced and dynamic exchange between data suppliers and consumers.

## Objectives

1. **Standardization**: Develop a structured methodology for creating and sharing modular, reusable use case components within enterprise knowledge graphs.
2. **Central Registry of Reusable Use Cases**: Establish a central repository for publishing production-ready use cases, positioning EKG use cases as reusable "apps" or components that enterprises can integrate directly into their EKG environments.
3. **Community and Adoption Support**: Foster awareness and provide resources to support the adoption of the UCT framework across industries and related EKGF workgroups.
4. **Alignment with Strategic Business Outcomes**: Ensure use case trees bridge business needs with technology, driving strategic outcomes and robust data governance within a supply-and-demand framework for enterprise data.

## Key Results

- **Repository Establishment**: Launch and maintain a central registry of reusable, production-ready use cases accessible to the EKG community, enabling enterprises to share and adopt EKG components.
- **Framework and Methodology Publication**: Finalize and disseminate a structured UCT framework with guidelines, templates, and best practices for defining, sharing, and managing use cases in hierarchical models.
- **Adoption Milestone**: Achieve pilot implementation of the UCT framework by at least three organizations by mid-2025.
- **Educational Outreach**: Publish white papers, tutorials, and talks to promote UCT adoption, particularly emphasizing the benefits of reusable, production-ready components in enterprise knowledge graph environments.
- **Intergroup Collaboration**: Engage with the Data Products Workgroup and other EKGF groups to ensure alignment and interoperability between use case trees and related methodologies.

## Mode of Operation

- **Weekly Calls**: Regular meetings to discuss progress, resolve issues, and align on deliverables.
- **Documentation and Resources**: Produce comprehensive documentation on use case tree structures, workflows, personas, and outcomes to guide industry practitioners in implementing UCT.
- **Community Engagement**: Organize webinars, presentations, and training sessions to promote the advantages of modular and reusable use case designs.
- **Collaboration and Feedback**: Partner with other EKGF workgroups to gather feedback, explore synergies, and refine UCT methodologies.
- **Standards Pathway**: Facilitate OMG standardization processes for the UCT framework, preparing the methodology and repository for industry-wide adoption.
