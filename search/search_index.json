In other words, \"the Business\" or \"the Customer\", the end user of a system or application, is responsible for explaining to the people who need to deliver that system what the system is supposed to do.                     </p> <p>Makes sense right? Unfortunately, it's usually not that simple. All kinds of other factors come into play that have nothing to do with specifying what the user really wants such as design, architecture, existing systems, budgets, time, regulations, policies  and technical capabilities.</p> <p>However, it is a good thing to at least capture the \"real\" wishes of the user without having to consider all of  those other aspects.

This method proposes to use \"Structured Business User Stories\" to achieve many things such as:                  </p> <ul> <li>have a more strategic view on which functionality is really required                                          </li> <li>allow to see \"the disconnect\" or \"the gap\" between what's required and what is currently available,    delivered and deliverable                                                                                     </li> <li>avoid \"tunnel thinking\" where everyone, especially also \"the business\" itself, makes all kinds of    assumptions that may or may not be true and could severely diminish creativity.                               </li> <li>create a clear separation of concerns: the business specifies what they need but leaves it to the    data and technology people to work out how they can deliver it.    So no more \"screen designs\" (that comes later) or \"schema's\" that are used as    \"functional specification\".    We need to be able to go deeper, to the core questions about \"what do you really need?\"     (and forget about the \"How\" for a minute).                                                                                </li> <li>have clear testable specifications of required functionality for the whole life-cycle of a given                user story.     As long as people need a given story to be implemented, it will continuously be tested \"end-to-end\",    from inception all the way to production, not only before deployment into production but actually    also in production itself.    The EKG knows about \"its Stories\" and continuously tests them, it therefore knows about its own    \"functional health\" and can detect whenever something changes (code, ontologies, ETL, new policies)     whether it can still deliver all functionality                                 </li> </ul> <p>Here's a diagram that illustrates how we can break up a user story in some interesting components that we can link to other data structures in the Knowledge Graph such as a taxonomy of all \"Personas\"</p> <p>   TODO </p> <p>Here's one example of a User Story, more examples will follow later:                                            </p> <p>   TODO </p>", "title": "Story"}, {"location": "concept/use-case-tree/", "text": "<p>Warn</p> <p>Work in progress</p>", "title": "Use Case Tree (UCT)"}, {"location": "concept/use-case/", "text": "Business &amp; Management AudienceData &amp; Tech AudienceKey componentsLife cycleSimilar Concepts   <p>A Use Case specifies a distinct set of business requirements \u2014 ideally but not necessarily captured as an \"executable model\" \u2014 resulting in a specific business outcome.</p> <p>It starts with ideas for use cases that could come from any person in  the organization at any point in time.

For any given development of a business capability that is supported  by technology, different groups of people, often across many departments, will get involved and they all have their own way of looking at it. There is no shared language, not one single artifact that they can  all talk to and reason about. The Use Case Tree is that single artifact.  It provides one single construct, owned by the business, and  primarily driven by business strategy, that every group of people,  every specialist, can relate their way of thinking to.

However, there is still the risk of creating isolated digital environments  and other barriers that may prevent public administrators from connecting with each other.  Therefore, the European Commission has created the  European Interoperability Framework (EIF) to guide administrations within member states to set up and run  interoperable systems. Although this framework had been developed for governments of local states,  its contents can be applied to enterprises and this is the purpose of  this chapter.</p> <p>First, Interoperability is defined by the European Commission (2017) as;  \u201cthe ability of organisations to interact towards mutually beneficial goals, involving the sharing of information and knowledge between these organizations,  through the business processes they support, by means of the exchange of data  between their ICT systems.\u201d</p> <p>The European Interoperability Framework is based on 12 principles that are  fundamental behavioral aspects to drive interoperability actions.  Some of these principles are:</p> <ol> <li>Openness. Data should be published and shared as much as possible.     This could help save development costs, avoid a lock-in effect and    create synergies within the enterprise.     Additionally, the level of openness of a specification/standard is     a key aspect of the reuse of the underlying data or software     implementing that specification.</li> <li>Transparency. Transparency in the EIF consists of (1) visibility,    (2) availability of interfaces, and (3) the protection of personal data.     First, visibility is about allowing other players such as customers,     other businesses, and governments to view and understand administrative     rules, processes, data, services, and decision-making.     Second, interfaces between heterogeneous and disparate information     systems are necessary to make these systems work together and their     interfaces are thus crucial for interoperability.     Third, applicable legal frameworks for handling large amounts of     personal data such as GDPR should be respected.</li> <li>Reusability. The reusability of IT solutions, information and     data is an enabler of interoperability and improves quality because    it extends operational use while saving money and time.</li> <li>Technological neutrality and data portability.     Technological neutrality (i.e. technology agnosticism) means focusing    on functional needs and deferring decisions on technology as long as     possible to minimize technological dependencies, to avoid imposing specific    technical implementations or products on their constituents, and to be     able to adapt to the rapidly evolving technological environment.     Additionally, data portability refers to the ability to move and reuse     data easily across different applications and systems as means to     avoid lock-in and ensure interoperability as well.</li> <li>User-centricity. User needs and requirements should guide the     design and development of services in accordance with the three     expectations.     First, a multi-channel services delivery approach means that     availability of alternative channels (physical and digital) to access a     service and it is important as users may prefer different channels     depending on the circumstances and their needs.     Second, a single point of contact should be made available to users    to hide internal administrative complexity and facilitate access to    a service.     Third, User feedback should be systematically collected, assessed,     and used to design new services and to further improve existing ones.</li> <li>Administrative simplification.     Digitization of services should take place in accordance with     (1) digital-by-default, (2) digital-first.     The former means that there should be at least one digital channel    available for each service.     The latter concept means that priority must be given to using     services via digital channels while applying the multi-channel     delivery concept and no-wrong-door policy.</li> <li>Preservation of information.</li> <li>Assessment of effectiveness and efficiency.</li> </ol> <p>The EIF describes an interoperability model that consists of four layers as depicted in figure 1 below.  This model depicts the so-called interoperability governance which  is defined as; \u201cdecisions on interoperability frameworks,  institutional arrangements, organizational structures,  roles and responsibilities, policies, agreements and other aspects  of ensuring and monitoring interoperability at national and EU levels.\u201d</p>  <p> </p> Fig 1: Interoperability Governance", "title": "The European Interoperability Framework (EIF)"}, {"location": "objective/interoperability/#legal-interoperability", "text": "<p>Legal interoperability is about ensuring that organizations or parts of organizations operating under different legal frameworks, policies,  and strategies are able to work together.</p>", "title": "Legal interoperability"}, {"location": "objective/interoperability/#organizational-interoperability", "text": "<p>This interoperability layer concerns the way in which organizations align their business processes, responsibilities, and expectations to achieve commonly agreed and mutually beneficial goals.

Subsequently, large investments need to be taken to even  start the project and the project won\u2019t deliver, in most cases,  any value until completion.  Even a project that is 95% complete, is often of no use to  anyone until it is delivered, such as in the case of a  nuclear plant.  This problem also increases the risk that the project may get out  of hand by requiring more time and budget while also failing  on fulfilling the original project expectations. Additionally, this approach offers little to no scalability potential.</p> <p>As a far more compelling approach, such large projects should, according to Flyvbjerg, be divided in smaller subprojects that can be tackled separately and where each should deliver value independently of the rest.</p>  Prof. Bent Flyvbjerg <p>   Prof. Bent Flyvbjerg   Professor Bent Flyvbjerg is the Executive Chairman of  Oxford Global Projects. He has 30+ years of experience as an advisor to government and business, including the US, UK, and Chinese governments, Fortune 500 companies,  and top consultancies. Flyvbjerg is the most cited scholar in the world on project management.  He is the first BT Professor and Inaugural Chair of  Major Programme Management at Oxford University and holds the  Villum Kann Rasmussen Professorship and Chair at the  IT University of Copenhagen.  He has received numerous honors and awards for his work on  better project management, including a knighthood and two  Fulbright Scholarships.  </p>  <p>Flyvbjerg uses Madrid\u2019s subway system as a mere example to illustrate  the value of this approach.  Manuel Melis Maynar was the person responsible for Madrid  subway extension which added 131 km of rail, 79 new stations.  This project started in 1995 and ended in 2003.  Nonetheless, this project was and is still considered as a  success story as it set records in terms of its speed and  costs compared to other similar projects took up to 10 or 20  years and cost much more that initially expected.  This radical difference stems from a number of decisions  that Melis took before starting this project:</p> <ul> <li>No monuments: Monuments and other forms of signature    architecture can be found in many subway stations but they are    also associated with cost overruns and delays.    Therefore, Manuel decided not to include any in its 79    stations and each station may follow a predefined replicable   modular design based on well-proved construction methods.</li> <li>No new technology: Manuel avoided relying on new    construction techniques, tools or methods as they could add    risk to the project.    Instead, he relied on well-proved techniques, tools and    methods that had proved to deliver results fastly, cheaply,    safely, and at a high level of quality.</li> <li>Speed: Time is like a window as the bigger it is,    the more bad stuff can fly through it.    Manuel understood this as he determined that the project    needed to be delivered in incremental steps of 3-6 kilometers.   This may enable workers and him to get feedback after each    step and to foster positive learning.    In other projects, this may also make possible to deliver    value to customers as soon as possible. </li> </ul> <p>Using this mega-project and other successful ones such  Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory, Flyvbjerg identified the principles  behind scaling up in a smart way.  By smart way, he means starting from small beginning to a  large project through experimentation and relying on  essentially identical modules.  The opposite of this is to start on a massive scale with  a project that mainly uses bespoke components.  According to Flyvberg, the principles behind smart scale-ups  are the following:</p> <ul> <li>Speed: As stated by former Google\u2019s CEO, Eric Schmidt;   \u201cCreate a product, ship it, see how it does, design and    implement improvements, and push it back out.    Ship and iterate.   The companies that are the fastest at this process will win\u201d.    Speed is critical for companies not only to create momentum    but also to create a feedback loop between the company and    its environment to foster positive learningpositive learning within companies.    Positive learning is defined by Flyvbjerg as; \u201clearning to    do things faster, better, and cheaper by doing the same    thing over and over, through replicated modules\u201d.    Additionally, tighter time frames result in more controllable   chunks of work whose budget and other estimates are easier   to calculate and are more reliable.</li> <li>Replicable modularity: By relying on rather high-quality   identical modules that can be assembled into a larger project,    project managers can foster positive learning that will result   in performance increases, lower project management risks and    in meeting the project expectations.    Additionally, working incremental steps also offers delivering   customer value without having to complete the whole project   first.   For example, Tesla\u2019s Gigafactory consists of different blocks   that can be operated once completed and that can start   producing batteries long before the whole Gigafactory has   been finished.   Lastly, relying on modules, whose value and workings have been   tested before, significantly lowers the risks associated to   bespoke solutions.</li> </ul> <p>Although these concepts are not new to many engineering fields,  they are rather new in the business world.  However, they have been gaining attention recently by consulting  companies such as Gartner with the so-called  Composable Business which means;  \u201ccreating an organization made from interchangeable  building blocks.\u201d  As stated by Gartner;  \u201cA composable business is architected for real-time  adaptability and resilience in the face of uncertainty.\u201d  In turn, other companies such as  WalkMe,  Elastic Path and Venture Leap consider packaged business capabilities as the  building blocks of composable businesses.</p>", "title": "Modularity"}, {"location": "objective/modularity/#sources", "text": "<ul> <li>Oxford Global Projects Academy - Smart Scaling: Modularity &amp; Speed</li> <li>Flyvbjerg, Bent, Harvard Business Review - Make Megaprojects More Modular</li> <li>Flyvbjerg, Bent, Make Megaprojects More Modular (October 19, 2021).

It serves many use cases, and it deals with many completely different back-end systems\u2014upstream source systems or downstream consumers\u2014each of which evolves  over time as well.  Upstream and downstream partners all need to move forward where the CoE needs to be able to respond in a timely manner.
