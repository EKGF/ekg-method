They are concerns of different departments; different groups of specialists think about these concepts in their own way and have their own practices and models for it.  For any given development of a business capability that is supported  by technology, different groups of people, often across many departments, will get involved and they all have their own way of looking at it. There is no shared language, not one single artifact that they can  all talk to and reason about. The Use Case Tree is that single artifact.  It provides one single construct, owned by the business, and  primarily driven by business strategy, that every group of people,  every specialist, can relate their way of thinking to.  This includes not only data and technology specialists but also project managers, financial managers, security and compliance officers, operations engineers and so forth.  All their models and different ways of looking at a given capability  can be plugged into the Use Case Tree as different views.</p> <p>Everything we ever do in a business, especially in the data and technology pillars of that enterprise, should be related to a use case in the Use Case Tree.</p> <p>The Use Case Tree is a breakdown of strategic planned-for  capabilities into smaller building blocks, all called use cases.
